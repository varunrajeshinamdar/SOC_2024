# SOC_2024

Till now we have done two sets of problems (the third one based on greedy algorithms and dynamic programming is going on). The first problem set was shared to us through a github repository (based on sliding window, queues, stacks, deques and bit manipulations) while the second and third are being hosted on codeforces. The second was based on searching & sorting, divide & conquer and hashing.
Before each problem set which consisted of 10 problems, we were given some time to prepare and then about a week to solve and submit those questions.
